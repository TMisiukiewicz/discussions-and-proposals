# RFC0000: Support Expo Config Plugins in React Native apps

## Summary

Upstream part of Expo Config Plugins into React Native core to support modifying application's config without having to manually edit the native files.

## Basic example

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13985840/229797752-81009e28-3153-4702-b52f-14602789a87b.mov

In this example, when running `start` command, Android permissions defined in `app.json` are added to `AndroidManifest.xml` file, and a new key is added into `Info.plist` file based on a custom plugin:

```js
module.exports = function (config, { apiKey }) {
    // Ensure the objects exist
    if (!config.ios) {
      config.ios = {};
    }
    if (!config.ios.infoPlist) {
      config.ios.infoPlist = {};
    }
  
    // Append the apiKey
    config.ios.infoPlist['MY_CUSTOM_NATIVE_IOS_API_KEY'] = apiKey;
  
    return config;
  };
```

### Code samples

[Example implementation of `prebuild` command into React Native CLI, based on Expo Config Plugins](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/compare/main...TMisiukiewicz:cli:prebuild)

This is a quick PoC on how we could possibly adapt config plugins into CLI. Prebuild command is very similar to the one from Expo CLI, it just doesn't contain Expo-related things

[Possible implementation in React Native app, and how it affects native files](https://github.com/TMisiukiewicz/MyTestApp/compare/main...test-appjson)

This PoC shows how `prebuild` command affects the native code. Find `app.json` file first, see how config for both platforms is defined here, and then go through all the changes in the native files to check what changes were made after using `prebuild`

[Create custom plugin for `react-native-image-picker` library](https://github.com/react-native-image-picker/react-native-image-picker/compare/main...TMisiukiewicz:react-native-image-picker:create-plugin)

[Usage of created custom plugin in the example app](https://github.com/TMisiukiewicz/MyTestApp/compare/expo-custom-mod...add-rn-lib)

To proof that it would benefit libraries maintainers and community, I created a simple plugin for `react-native-image-picker` library, which allows to set the description messages for required permissions through `app.json`. Plugin is applied in `plugins` array and it's overwriting `Info.plist` values.

## Motivation
According to the [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/config-plugins/), config plugins are a system for extending Expo config and customizing the prebuild phase of managed builds. Expo CLI is using it internally to generate and configure all the native code for managed projects.

Based on that, for the purpose of this RFC, I'd define "Config Plugins" as a set of configuration options for React Native app, providing a standarized way of generating and configuring native code for any platform.

The main motivation between this proposal is to create a standarized way of generating and configuring native side of React Native projects for any platform, including Out-of-Tree platforms. Currently using config plugins is available only to projects based on Expo. It is very powerful, but it's limited only to Android and iOS, currently with no vision to support more platforms. With moving parts of it into the core of React Native, we would unlock a possibility of creating config plugins for Out-of-Tree platforms, like Windows and MacOS, in a standarized way. Additionally, we would make the process of upgrading apps to the newest React Native version much simplier than it works now. Very often it requires some additional manual steps on the native side, resolving conflicts etc. With Expo Config Plugins implemented into React Native, it would be possible to store all the native-related config on the JS side and apply it into native files whenever it's needed, e.g while running `react-native upgrade` - without having Expo in the project. 

## Detailed design

### Proposal of the new workflow
![Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 11 01 31](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13985840/230034001-4e40b04a-f474-47a9-98f7-15fdfa1bf7e8.png)
This diagram shows how the new workflow would work after doing all the required changes. "Config plugins" would become a part of React Native core, which then can be consumed by CLI, Expo, libraries and others.

> This implementation might be also related to [RFC: introduce reactNativeMetadata to package.json](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/588/files). At this moment design is covering usage of `app.json` file, but additionally it might fit into linked RFC as well.

The very first step would be upstreaming non-Expo related code of `@expo/config-plugins` and `@expo/config-types` into React Native core as a separate package in monorepo. It contains all logic and helpers needed to modify native side of RN project easily from JS side. We'd handle discussions with Expo to coordinate what parts of config plugins can be safely upstreamed into core. It has to be done in a way where Expo would still able to extend it on their side with all the stuff related to Expo, like EAS Builds etc.

Upstreaming it will unlock a few new paths that React Native could follow. First of all, and probably most important, it can change the way of generating native code. It would become possible to add platform-specific folders like `android` and `ios` to `.gitignore` by default and keep them out of the repository unless it's needed (e.g. when it's not possible to do some native-side changes with using config plugins). These folders would be automatically (re)generated when running one of the following commands:
- `start`
- `run-ios`
- `run-android`
- `build-ios`
- `build-android`
- `upgrade`

This would require having `@react-native/config-plugins` as a dependency of CLI.

> If it's possible in the future, we could move platform-specific code from CLI into the core to avoid that. It might be related to the [Move iOS and Android Specific Code to Their Own Packages](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/49/files) RFC.

All of the commands would use newly created method that would apply all the changes defined in `app.json` file. Expo is using this file to determine how to load the app config in Expo Go and Expo Prebuild. With config plugins implemented, this file could work the same way as in Expo, but, by default, it would not support Expo-related properties (Expo will still be able to easily extend this config to match their needs). You can get more info about configuration with app.json in Expo [here](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration). It will also become an opportunity to create configurations for Out-of-Tree Platforms. 

Here's the list of Expo Config properties, divided by those that React Native could possibly handle out of the box, and the Expo-specific ones:

The CLI would look for any changes in the `app.json` file and regenerate the platform-specific folders when running one of the React Native commands.

Additionally, it would become possible to create custom plugins within the app. Since the plugins would be available to import directly from the core, it would not need any additional setup on the developer side. E.g. developer can easily create a custom plugin:

`./plugins/withStringsXml.js`:
```js
const { AndroidConfig, withStringsXml } = require('@react-native/config-plugins')

module.exports = function (config) {
    return withStringsXml(config, (conf) => {
      conf.modResults = AndroidConfig.Strings.setStringItem(
        [
          {
            _: 'true',
            $: {
              name: 'test_value',
              translatable: 'false'
            }
          }
        ],
        conf.modResults
      )
      return conf
    })
}
```
`app.json`:
```diff
{
  "name": "MyTestApp",
  "displayName": "MyTestApp",
+ "plugins": ["./plugins/withNewString.js"]
}
```
In the example above, custom plugin is using `withStringsXml` mod. Mods are async functions that modify native files. A list of the mods available for custom plugins:

#### Android
- `withAndroidManifest`
- `withStringsXml`
- `withAndroidColors`
- `withAndroidColorsNight`
- `withAndroidStyles`
- `withMainActivity`
- `withMainApplication`
- `withProjectBuildGradle`
- `withAppBuildGradle`
- `withSettingsGradle`
- `withGradleProperties`

#### iOS
- `withAppDelegate`
- `withInfoPlist`
- `withEntitlementsPlist`
- `withExpoPlist`
- `withXcodeProject`
- `withPodfileProperties`

It would also be possible to use all of the helpers currently available in `@expo/config-plugins`, like `AndroidConfig.Strings.setStringItem` in the example above.

The mods can be also are appended to the mods object of the configuration. This section varies from the other parts of the configuration as it is not serialized after the initial reading. It's possible to utilize it to execute operations while generating code. In general, creating custom plugins with mod functions are simpler to work with, so it's recommended to use it instead of using `mods` object in `app.json`.

### `prebuild` command
Additionally, React Native CLI would have a couple of new commands, similar to `prebuild` known from Expo CLI. The method applying config plugins into native code would run with the commands mentioned above, but, `prebuild` command would additionally add the native files into repository to make sure developers can safely make any manual changes in native folders. If there is a need of prebuilding only one of the platforms, it would be possible to use `prebuild-android` and `prebuild-ios` commands. Prebuild would run all config plugins to apply all of the necessary changes. There should also be a possibility of using `--clean` flag with prebuild to install fresh copy of native directories and apply all config plugins. It should be used only if there are no manual changes made to native files.

### Library development

These changes would possibly also affect libraries development and allow maintainers to use this API within libraries. Based on the [Expo tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/modules/config-plugin-and-native-module-tutorial/), we could add support for `app.plugin.js` file for libraries and then declare them under `"plugins"` property in `app.json` the same way Expo is doing that with their libraries:
```diff
{
    "name": "MyTestApp",
    "displayName": "MyTestApp",
+   "plugins": [
+      [
+        "expo-camera",
+         {
+           "cameraPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your camera."
+         }
+      ]
+   ]
}
```

You can find an example built for `react-native-image-picker` library in [Code samples](https://github.com/TMisiukiewicz/discussions-and-proposals/blob/rfc-config-plugins/proposals/0000-implement-config-plugins.md#code-samples) section.

If config plugins become a standard, we could provide support for it in [create-react-native-library](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-builder-bob).

## Potential benefits

### Improved updates
With this solution it seems like upgrading React Native would become much easier. Each time React Native gets upgraded, we can just copy-paste fresh iOS and Android templates from RN core and apply all the changes using config plugins. We could track if any manual changes were made in the native folders, and if yes, warn user about it and allow to upgrade only in an old way.

> For updating dependencies we could utilize [@rnx-kit/align-deps](https://microsoft.github.io/rnx-kit/docs/tools/align-deps)

### Support for other platforms
This approach would also make it possible to extend config plugins with other platforms, e.g. `react-native-windows`. Following the same pattern, a support for `windows` and `macos` properties could be added to `app.json` together with some custom mods for native files.

## Drawbacks

- some of the mods are operating on regexes, which makes them dangerous to use - especially when core developers are modifying template. Config plugins cannot cover every usage scenario safely. We suggest having some markers to allow modifying templates only between them. List of files modified based on regex: `MainActivity.java`, `MainApplication.java`, `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, `AppDelegate.m`
- might take some time for maintainers to adjust libraries to new approach
- bringing config plugins into core might generate scenarios where dependencies are making incompatible changes, so it might get hard to debug

## Alternatives

- integrating `@expo/config-plugins` with React Native CLI to unlock a path for developers to run `yarn add @expo/config-plugins` in their non-Expo projects and use it - we might end up with a misalignment between what parts of Expo Config Plugins we want to support in the CLI (everything that is not related to Expo) and what developers will be able to use in their projects (everything, even if it's Expo-specific). This may lead to many misunderstandings why some of the properties in `app.json` or some mods are not working.
- creating a new library based on Expo Config Plugins, exposing only stuff not related to Expo - it's not making Config Plugins a standard in the RN ecosystem, as it makes it totally optional to have it as a dependency in projects and libraries
- creating a brand new CLI supporting Config Plugins - we won't fix the major problem of the apps currently running on React Native CLI - easy RN upgrades. It would be another tool existing in the RN ecosystem, still requiring to add a new dependency to projects/libraries and working only when using it with specific tool.
- ~~moving native folders to temporary directory instead of having it in the project root - it would cause a lot of issues regarding native folders paths~~
- ~~creating separate package with native folders to modify it directly in node_modules - same as above, additionally it could generate some yarn/npm-specific issues~~
- [`microsoft/react-native-test-app`](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-test-app) - it already has config plugins implemented, but in our opinion config plugins need broader adoption

> RNTA does not have platform specific files checked in, they are provided by RNTA package or generated at a build time. However some of the files are in the repository, e.g. `Podfile` or `build.gradle`, but they have some configs applied directly from RNTA package.  

## Adoption strategy

- [ ] In close cooperation with Expo, upstreaming config plugins into RN core in a way that would help them easily adjust their tools.
- [ ] changes should be applied into `react-native-cli` to support config plugins.
- [ ] Both React Native and CLI should be covered with proper documentation:
- `reactnative.dev` with detailed description what config plugins are and how to use them - for both developers and library maintainers
- CLI's `README.md` file with detailed explanation of `prebuild` command and available flags
- [ ] community and maintainers should be informed about new API available and how it would benefit them
- [ ]  at the same time, [`create-react-native-library`](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-builder-bob) should be adjusted to support the new API.

## How we teach this

- React Native docs should be updated, describing well the new approach, Expo documentation would be very helpful here
- Post on React Native blog with explanation and some examples how it works and how it benefits developers and community in general
- Conferences talks, e.g. on React Native EU, to reach as large audience as possible.

From entry level developers perspective, using `app.json` file to handle configuration should be very easy. Creating custom plugins and using mods is a bit more difficult, but in general should be done by developers only when needed. Possibly the biggest audience here are library maintainers, with good understanding of the concept they will be able to adopt it into the libraries. Developers creating apps probably wouldn't have to worry about config plugins unless they need to create one.

## Unresolved questions
- What terminology should we use to distinguish approach with native folders kept out of repository and after prebuilding?
- How should we determine what to keep in `app.json` and `react-native.config.js`? Does [RFC: introduce reactNativeMetadata to package.json](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/588/files) affect this proposal?
- Could we utilize some work already done on [microsoft/react-native-test-app](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-test-app)?
